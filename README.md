1. I would fit the automated tests for the Recipe proejct within a Github action that runs every time the code is pushed. This way it ensures that tests are run and working. It would be good to be able to manually run some locally just as a sanity check for the programmer, but the most important point is to run the tests before pushing the code into the main branch where it will be deployed.
2. An end to end test would be used to check if a function is running correctly given the user input.
